## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. When a burner is lit, a timer starts using the formula:  
   **`200 + Firemaking level` ticks**
2. At a configurable point (default **10 seconds** before burnout is possible), a **notification** is sent.
3. If the burner is not re-lit by the time the random burnout phase starts, a **sound alarm** is played.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è RuneLite tick = 0.6 seconds
